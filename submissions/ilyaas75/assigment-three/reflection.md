This is where you explain the "Why" behind your code. Use the table below as a guide for what to write.Key Justifications to Include:Decision StepYour Reasoning (The "Why")Median ImputationI used the median for Odometer_km because it is robust to extreme outliers (like cars with very high mileage) which would skew the mean.Mode ImputationFor Doors and Location, the mode was used because these are discrete categories. Using a mean would result in impossible values like "3.4 doors."IQR CappingInstead of deleting rows, I clipped values to the IQR bounds. This preserves the dataset size while preventing outliers from confusing the model.Log TransformationI added LogPrice because the target (Price) was right-skewed. Taking the log normalizes the distribution, making it easier for models to learn.Standard ScalingI only scaled continuous features ($X$). I avoided scaling the 0/1 dummy variables to maintain their interpretability as binary flags.
